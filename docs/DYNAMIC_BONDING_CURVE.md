# Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) - User Guide

## What is Dynamic Bonding Curve?

Dynamic Bonding Curve (DBC) is LaunchPad's fair launch mechanism that creates a smooth price discovery process for new tokens. Instead of setting an arbitrary price, DBC lets the market naturally determine your token's value through real trading activity.

### Why Use DBC?

**Traditional Token Launches:**
- Manual liquidity pool setup (complex)
- Risk of rug pulls (creators can remove liquidity)
- Unpredictable initial pricing
- Manual migration to trading platforms

**With Dynamic Bonding Curve:**
- ✅ **Automatic Price Discovery** - Price increases as people buy
- ✅ **Anti-Rug Protection** - Liquidity is locked automatically
- ✅ **Fair Launch** - Everyone gets the same price at the same time
- ✅ **Seamless Migration** - Automatically moves to full trading when threshold is hit
- ✅ **No Manual Work** - Set it and forget it

---

## How It Works (Simple Version)

### 1. You Create Your Token
- Choose name, symbol, and upload logo
- Set your token parameters
- LaunchPad handles the rest

### 2. Trading Begins on the Curve
- Initial price starts low (e.g., $0.001 per token)
- As people buy, price gradually increases
- Follows a smooth bonding curve from $1,000 → $10,000 market cap
- No sudden jumps or crashes

### 3. Automatic Migration
When your token hits **10 SOL** in liquidity:
- **Automatically migrates** to Meteora DLMM (full trading platform)
- Liquidity gets locked (10% permanently, 90% tradeable)
- Your token graduates to real DeFi trading
- You earn fees from all trades forever

### 4. You Earn Revenue
- **While on bonding curve:** Earn from trading fees
- **After migration:** Continue earning from liquidity pool fees
- **50/50 split** between you and LaunchPad platform

## Price Example: How the Curve Works

Let's say you launch "MOON Token":

| Buys | Market Cap | Price Per Token | Your Position |
|------|------------|-----------------|---------------|
| **Start** | $1,000 | $0.001 | Token created! |
| After $2,500 bought | $3,500 | $0.0035 | 3.5x price increase |
| After $5,000 bought | $6,000 | $0.006 | 6x from start |
| **Migration** | $10,000 | $0.01 | 10x - Graduates to DLMM! |

**Key Point:** Early supporters get better prices, creating natural incentive to buy early.

## Frequently Asked Questions

### How much does it cost to launch a token?

**One-time cost:** 0.05 SOL (~$5 USD at current prices)

This covers:
- Token creation
- Bonding curve setup
- Migration configuration
- Platform fees

### When do I start earning?

**Immediately!** You earn 50% of trading fees from the first trade.

Earnings are:
- Calculated automatically
- Viewable in dashboard
- Claimable anytime
- Paid in SOL

### What happens if my token doesn't reach 10 SOL?

Your token stays on the bonding curve indefinitely. It can:
- Continue trading at current price
- Still earn fees from trades
- Reach migration threshold later
- Be traded by community

There's no "failure" - the curve stays live.

### Can I remove liquidity or rug pull?

**No.** This is by design.

- 10% liquidity is permanently locked
- Your 45% share is in LP tokens (not removable)
- Platform's 45% share is also locked in LP
- This protects all token holders

### How long until migration?

**It depends on demand:**
- High demand: Could hit 10 SOL in hours
- Medium demand: Days to weeks
- Low demand: May take months or never

Migration is triggered by trading volume, not time.

### Can I customize the bonding curve?

Not yet. Current settings are:
- Start: $1,000 market cap
- End: $10,000 market cap
- Migration: 10 SOL threshold
- Fees: 1% → 0.25% over 24h

Custom curves may be available in future updates.

### What blockchain is this on?

**Solana.** 

LaunchPad uses Solana because:
- Fast transactions (400ms confirmation)
- Low fees (~$0.0001 per trade)
- Large DeFi ecosystem
- Meteora integration

### Do I need coding knowledge?

**No!** The entire process is:
1. Fill out web form
2. Upload logo
3. Click "Create"
4. Sign with wallet

No code required.
