# Development Rules - LaunchPad Platform

**Updated:** 2026-02-03 01:22 UTC

## Mandatory Rules (from Chadizzle)

### Testing Before Commits ⚠️
**ALL code must be tested before committing and pushing.**

For each component/feature:
1. ✅ Write the code
2. ✅ Test it thoroughly (manual testing in browser)
3. ✅ Verify it works correctly
4. ✅ Fix any bugs/issues
5. ✅ THEN commit and push

**DO NOT commit untested code.**

If something doesn't work, fix it before pushing.

### Production Focus
- Production code only, no mocks/placeholders
- Real Solana integration (Meteora APIs)
- Mobile-first (Angular + Ionic)
- Beautiful UI (animations, smooth transitions)
- Reference: gmgn.ai, pump.fun

### Commit Frequency
- Commit after each major component
- Include clear commit messages
- Push to GitHub immediately after commit

### Code Quality
- Clean, readable code
- Proper error handling
- TypeScript strict mode
- Follow Angular best practices
- Use Ionic components

**Violation of these rules will result in work being rejected.**
